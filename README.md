# Peer Review - DF for MS

Meg, this is an excellent project. I learned about the power of the *psych* package and the content you visualized was really interesting theoretically. I made a few **minor** changes in-line of your .rmd file; please take these as suggestions. The other components of my peer-review are below:

## Areas of Strength
1. Your visualizations tell a coheret and theoretically interesting story. The links between public governmental trust and policy compliance are clear from the outset with your first visualization, and then you lead the reader (viewer?) to follow up questions that are answerable with visualizations 2 and 3. I was particularly interested in the first heatmap / correlation table from the third visualization.
2. I enjoyed the interactivity of the third visualization, such that I could identify exact correlation values for each cell. It also seemed to me as though the heatmap was best suited to interactivity, so great pick!
3. Your second data visualization is exceptionally well done aesthetically. I think you absolutely nailed the best-case use of ggridges, with appropriate use of transparency, color, overlap.
